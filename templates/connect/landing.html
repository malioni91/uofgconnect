        <p>UofG Connect’s primary objective is to help students find their friends’ location around the campus and provide an intuitive interface to keep them in touch. Students will be able to register only through their university e-mail address and once logged in, they could search for their friends. The app will then display the friends’ location, and allow the user to filter the list of displayed friends by their name.</p>
